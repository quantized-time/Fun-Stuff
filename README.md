This will be a collection of some interesting things I pick up along the way, starting from Summer'24. <br> <br>

Cats&Dynamics: A collection of stuff I found very useful during my tenure as Project Member, Dynamix (I made a promise to myself that I will only put up stuff that I have done properly, so that I have a solid idea of whether it is actually good or not). Of course, this won't include the official material. <br><br>

Mathingies: A collection of anything I find interesting in math, which will probably include nice integrals or other nice questions. <br><br>

Oppurtunities: A list of things to look out for.

Resonance: A collection of articles from the journal that I've read
